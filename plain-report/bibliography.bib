  abstract = {Electric fish generate electric fields to infer properties of their environment and to communicate with each other. What does an electrosensory world look like? What are the basic physical laws governing electric image formation? This is discussed in four sections: temporal and spatial properties of electric fields generated by electric fish, electrolocation of small objects, electronavigation based on large nonconducting boundaries, and electrocommunication by frequency modulations of beats. Guided by the specific physics of these problems, behavioral, physical, and simulation findings are set into context. The dipole nature of the fish’s electric field and of polarized nearby objects inevitably limit electrolocation to the fish’s near field. Detection of capacitive objects as a different electric color is only possible if capacity, water conductivity and spectral properties of the fish’s electric field match. Water surface and large rocks as large nonconducting boundaries provide cues which are potentially detectable within a range of a meter and usable for electronavigation. Electrocommunication signals cover ranges up to 2 m and in wave fish are frequency modulations of beats on various timescales, ranging from tens of milliseconds to several minutes. We are just starting to understand their variety, their meaning and behavioral significance in courtship, breeding, aggression, group cohesion, etc. In addition to physical constraints, many selection pressures from predators and conspecifics act on electrosensory systems. We need more field data and need to explore the electric properties of ecological niches occupied by electric fish to really understand their adaptations and the costs of the various selection pressures.},
